# Introduction to Linux
### **Linux**
- Linux is a kernel.

### **What is kernel ?**
+ It is the interface between the software and the hardware.

    | Software|
    |---------|       
    | Kernel  | 
    | **Hardware**|

+ The **Kernel** + **System Softwares** make up an operating system. 

## **Evolution of GNU/Linux :fire: UNIX**
+ Linux **is NOT** an operating system.
+ Linux is the name of the kernel and is based on **UNIX**, another operating system.
+ The OS that uses it as the kernel is **GNU/Linux**.
+ Linux would have been incomplete without software of the **GNU** project and vice versa.
+ **UNIX** is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s by computer scientists **Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.**<br/>
BUT IT WASN‚ÄôT CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE. üò≠

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **let‚Äôs go back to 1980s**
+ **<u>Richard Stallman</u>**, an American software freedom activist, and a programmer is the founder of the GNU project.
+ The modern computers of the 1980s, now had their own operating systems, and none of them were free software and one had to sign a nondisclosure agreement. üò° Stallman found this whole idea of not being allowed to share and change the code, as unethical and antisocial, dividing the public and keeping users helpless. 
+ What was needed first was an operating system, without which software is useless. With a free operating system, he wanted to create a community possible once again.
+ The operating system **UNIX** was grown widely in the 1980s. Therefore, he choose to make the system compatible with Unix so that Unix users could easily switch to it and named it **GNU**, a recursive acronym for "**GNU‚Äôs üòé Not Unix" .**
+ Slowly, people were getting involved in the GNU project.

However, in the 1990s they were having problems developing kernel. The kernel, which they had named **Hurd**, was not working and without a kernel, an operating system is useless. :confused:

 
+ üí° This is when one of the most famous messages of the computing world was posted:   
##

    ‚ÄúHello, everybody out there using minix ‚Äì I‚Äôm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won‚Äôt be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Linus Torvalds; Posting to comp.os.minix; 25 August 1991.

This is how the **üë∂ ‚ÄòGNU/Linux‚Äô** was born. Torvalds had written the kernel of the system and the software used to complete the operating system were of the GNU project. So, the term GNU/Linux is used to express the operating system as the combination of the GNU system with Linux as the kernel.

### **What is Shell ?**
+ Users communicate with the
kernel by the shell
#### **Types of Shells**
 + Based on their features 
    + SH
    + BASH
    + ZSH
    + FISH

+ They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation,
some kind of features.

+ üëâ echo $SHELL

## **What is OS-Operating system ?**
   + Kernel
   + Softwares
   + Desktop environment
   + File extensions
   + Window manager

**<u>A Desktop environment</u>**<br/>
 + is a collection of software running on top of an operating system that makes up the desktop Graphical User Interface  sometimes described as a graphical shell.

 + It packs in different components like the taskbar, start menu, widgets, file manager, screen locker, theme manager, terminal emulator, and a lot more. 

+ A desktop environment (DE) usually rides on top of a Window Manager and adds many features, including panels, status bars, drag-and-drop capabilities, and a suite of integrated applications and tools. In fact, user opinions on operating systems are typically based on one thing: the Desktop Environment.

+ It usually includes everything from how the windows look and feel, to the style of the icons, files, folders, and the mouse pointers.



**<u>A window manager</u>**<br/>
+  is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface.

+ It puts the window decoration around the contents including the buttons to minimize or close. It allows resizing and moving the windows around, decides which window is on top.

+ allows the windows to be opened, closed, re-sized, and moved. It is also capable of presenting menus and options to the user. It controls the look and feel of the user's GUI.

**<u>A package manager or package-management</u>**<br/>
 system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.

### **Types of desktop environment on linux**
 + mate
 + gnome
 + KDE 
 + plasma
 + XFCE

    Which Desktop environment is best? Speed depends on:
   +   Animations
   +  High Graphics
   +  Quality

### **Window manager**
 + i3-window-manager

## **But Why Linux :confused: ?**
+ Most used 
+ Most hacking tools
+ Most Secured

### **What are Linux Distributions ?**
+ A complete Linux system package called a distribution.
+  Many Linux distributions are available to meet just about any computing requirement you could have

**Linux distributions/distro**
+ Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different:
    
    + Linux Kernel 
    
    + Packages(GNU)
    
    + Package Manager
    
    + Desktop UI


**Debian**
   + Kali linux
   + Ubuntu
   + Parrot

**Arch**
   + Black arch
   + Garuda

**Fedora**<br/>

**Red Hat**<br/>

**Gentoo**<br/>

**Android**<br/>


***

### **Which is best for hackers ?**

+ Kali linux
  + designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

+ Parrot Os
  + focus on security, privacy, and development.

+ Garuda
  +  distribution based on the Arch Linux operating
system

### **So ‚Ä¶ How can we use it?**

1. Main OS/ Main-boot
2. DualBoot / 2in1
3. Live boot
4. Cloud terminals
5. Virtual Machine
   + Softwares that gives you This ability:
      + HyberV
      + QEMU
      + Virtual Box - Oracle
      + VMware
6.  WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux
7. Termux - Android
