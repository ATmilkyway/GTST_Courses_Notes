## Script installation
+ Some hacking tools are developed by some peoples and those peoples make it open-source, that means we can get those scripts/programs from github.
● So we can download and use it. For this purpose git have a feature called ‘clone’

        git clone <link_of_the_script_from_github>

## Script modules
+ Scripts are made with scripting languages(programming) like { python,bash,go,ruby,...}
### Script :fire:vs:fire: Script Module
+ A script is a Python file that's intended to be run directly. When you run it, it should do something. This means that scripts will often contain code written outside the scope of any classes or functions. 
+ A module is a Python file that's intended to be imported into scripts or other modules.

Python: to install python modules we use -> 
       
    pip install <modulename>
For requirements file -> 

    pip install -r requirements.txt
Go: to install go modules -> 

    go install <modulename>
Ruby: to install ruby modules -> 
   
    gem install <modulename>

## If you need help on linux about commands
This will give you the whole manual and instruction of a tool or command.

    man <yourcommand>

👉Keys: arrow keys for navigation | q for quit

## Help
Some Commands have help option.
    
    <yourcommand> -h    
    <yourcommand> -help    
    <yourcommand> - -help

## Linux Processes & Services
As we interact with Linux, we create numbered instances of running programs called <b>“processes”</b>
+ To get the processes:

      ps [options]
👉 More commands

    ps               # for process running on my shell
    ps -A            # view all running process
    ps -u username   # view users process

## PID - Process ID

### To stop process
    Kill [options] [PID]
👉 More on kill
    
    kill -19 PID        # to stop the process    
    kill -18 PID        # to resume the process we stopped    
    kill -9 PID         # to Stop a process immediately

👉 there are 31 options.

😫 This is a time wasting process 😫

+ For this purpose we have the tool called 😃<b>‘top’</b> installed on linux by default.

+ But to make this fun we will use 😃😃😃<b>‘htop’</b>, it is colorful and more enhanced!

## Foreground / background
+ we have run commands at the prompt and waited for them to complete. We call this running in the <b>“foreground.”</b>

+ Use the “&” operator, to run programs in the “background” or press ^Z

👉To get the background process back to foreground 
    
    fg    #moves a background job in the current shell environment into the <b>foreground</b>
👉 To stop a process going inside your shell just press ^C 

## Null device 🎃
+ /dev/null - Redirects output to nowhere.
+ If you want to ignore output, you can send it to the null device, /dev/null. 
+ The null device is a special file that throws away whatever is fed to it 🎃. 
+ also called the bitbucket or blackhole. 
+ If you do not want to see errors on your screen and you do not want to save them to a file, you can redirect them to /dev/null
+ It is mainly used to discard standard output and standard error from an output.
## What is /dev?
In the Linux file system, everything is a file or a directory. Even devices are accessed as files. Your hard drive partitions, Pendrive, speakers, for all of these, there exists a file from which these are accessed. Now to understand how devices are accessed as files, think of it in this way: what do we do with a file? We read data from it and write data to it. A device like a speaker can input data to produce sound, a hard disk can be used to read and write data, a printer takes the input to print files, etc. Files and devices are similar in this way

/dev is a directory that stores all the physical and virtual devices of a Linux system. Physical devices are easy to understand, they are tangible devices like pen-drive, speakers, printers, etc. A Linux system also has virtual devices which act as a device but represent no physical device. 

## What is /dev/null?
It is a virtual device, which has a special property: Any data written to /dev/null vanishes or disappears. Because of this characteristic, it is also called bitbucket or blackhole. Let us see a demonstration.
## Standard output and standard error?
The output of a Linux command contains two streams of data: standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr0), while the standard output is the normal output if the command has no errors, the standard error is the error generated by the command. Output may contain both standard output and standard input.

+ On shell output there are 2 things.
    + STDERR = 2
    + STDOUT = 1

+ To redirect the errors from a command result we do 

    
      command 2> filename   
Here if you check the file you saved on it have errors only
+ To redirect the error-FREE output

        command 1>filename
        
So if we redirect our commands output to /dev/null we will get error free result
command 2> /dev/nul

## alias
+ Used to give a name to some bunch of commands.

      alias rex=’ls -la’
👉 But this doesn’t work after you closed the terminal
+ If you want to make it work You will add it to your shell config file
    + Example for bash and fish, zsh…
        + Bash = ~/.bashrc
        + Zsh = ~/.zshrc
        + Fish = ~/.config/fish/config.fish

## Tmux - Terminal Multiplexer
+ Tmux is used to classify our terminal work.
+ You can install it using apt. On kali it is built-in
+ Then to start it just type <b>‘tmux’</b>
  + To Create config file type
    + nano .tmux.conf  👉 (i.e Creating Hidden file)

    👉 Type this
            
            unbind C-b            
            unbind l            
            set -g prefix C-a            
            unbind %            
            bind e split-window -h            
            bind o split-window -v            
            set -g base-index 1            
            setw -g pane-base-index 1

👉 Save it | exit tmux and open again

## Wget
+ Is a tool used to download files from websites/servers

        wget [options] [link]
Example
        
    get https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf

## find
+ ON terminal if you want to search for files/folders/musics/Videos,

we can use find command.

find [search path] [options] [search word]

More commands

    find / -name “linux”
    find /home -perm 777
    find -type f | find -type d
